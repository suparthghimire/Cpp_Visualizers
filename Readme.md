### Tools Used

- C++
- C++ Graphics.h Library

---

### Running Application Locally

- The Application is created as Dev C++ console project thus Dev C++ is required
- The Application requires Graphics.h Library ro run

---

### Introduction

1. **Ray Casting**
   Implemented Using Line Line Intersection Algorithm. The program is interactive to user's mouse position and ray is casted relative to the position of cursor.
2. **Fourier Series**
   Referenced from [Understanding Fourier Series](http://bgrawi.com/Fourier-Visualizations/). The visualization is animated and runs indefinitely.
3. **Maze Generation Using DFS**
   Using Depth Forst Search (recursive algorithm), a maze is generated. The maze generation process (recursive backtracking) is animated.
4. **Bubble Sort**
   Animated Visualization of how Bubble SOrt Algorithm Works
5. **Particle Simulation**
   Using simple vector physics formula, the application is a particle simulation representing Fireworks cracking
   Refrenced From [Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/) by Daniel Shiffman
6. **Minimum Spanning Tree**
   Realtime calculation and visualization of nodes in a Minimum Spanning Tree. This uses Prim's Algorithm.
   The program is interactive to user's cursor, and a node is created at the coordinate where left mouse is clicked. At the same time, a nearest neighbour is found and and the two nodes are connected in Real Time.
7. **Mathematically Correct Flag of Nepal**
   Refrencinf the Constitution of Nepal on how to create the FLag correctly, the flag is created in the program..
